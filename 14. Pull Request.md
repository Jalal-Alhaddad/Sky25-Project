A pull request involves submitting code contributions to a project, allowing you to share your work with other developers for review and potential integration.

> GitHub's pull requests enable users to share modifications they've made to a branch in a repository, facilitating collaboration and review. When a pull request is initiated, collaborators can engage in discussions and assess proposed changes before merging them into the main branch. This process allows for iterative refinement and ensures the integrity of the codebase.

## Workflow for a pull request

- Developer creates a new branch from the main project repository.
- Developer makes changes to the code in their branch.
- Developer pushes the changes to their branch on the remote repository (e.g., GitHub).
- Developer opens a pull request, proposing their changes to be merged into the main branch.
- Other developers review the pull request, providing feedback and suggesting improvements.
- Developer makes necessary adjustments based on feedback.
- Once the changes are approved, the pull request is merged into the main branch, incorporating the modifications into the project.
